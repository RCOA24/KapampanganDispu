# Dispû Dining

**Preserving Heritage, Elevating Tradition.**

Dispû is a digital experience crafted for a high-end Kapampangan restaurant that marries the soul of 1920s San Fernando with contemporary culinary techniques. This project serves as a modern touchpoint for a brand built on legacy, offering an immersive introduction to authentic Kapampangan cuisine.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

-   **Immersive Visual Storytelling**: A design language built on "Modern Heritage"—combining classical typography (*Playfair Display*) with modern layout principles using a sophisticated palette of Deep Navy (`#22264b`) and Antique Cream (`#e6e2d3`).
-   **Seamless User Experience**:
    -   Fully responsive design optimized for all devices, preventing horizontal scroll issues on mobile.
    -   **Smart User Agent Detection**: Includes a custom `MessengerRedirect` component to guide users from in-app browsers (like Facebook Messenger) to full features browsers (Chrome/Safari) for an optimal experience.
    -   **Context-Aware Interactions**: Career application buttons intelligently switch between Gmail Web (Desktop) and Native Mail App (Mobile).
-   **Performance & SEO**: Built on Next.js 16 (App Router) with JSON-LD structured data for rich search integration (Restaurant Schema, Hours, Location).
-   **Interactive Elements**: Smooth scroll reveals, hover interactions on galleries, and a polished menu preview system powered by Framer Motion.
